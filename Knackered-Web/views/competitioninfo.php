<h2>TEST COMPETITION</h2>
<p>The file containing this test is views/competitioninfo.php.</p>
<p>Modify this file to create a custom index page for the competition</p>
<p>Bootstrap and JQuery are included by default, so go crazy!</p>
<h3>Competition Schedule:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>10AM: Start</li>
    <li>12PM: Lunch, no break in scoring</li>
    <li>5PM : Dinner, no break in scoring</li>
    <li>6PM : Bonus Challenge</li>
    <li>7PM : Scoring Stops</li>
    <li>9PM : Afterparty on the roof</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've never done this before, here's how to configure Knackered Engine:
<ol>
    <li>Use the Teams menu to add the competition's teams.</li>
    <li>Use the Services menu to add the teams' services. Each service needs an address, and a type (E.G. https, ssh, icmp). Supported checktypes can be found in Knackered-Backend/Runner.py. Creating your own checktypes is easy! </li>
    <li>Use the Logins menu to add login information to the services, for checks such as FTP or SSH which require a login. If no login is specified, the credentials 'default9001' will be used for both the username and password.</li>
    <li>Use the Web menu to create a Scoring Engine account for each team.</li>

</ol></p>
